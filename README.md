This repo is a companion repo to the main [flutter
repo](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). It contains the source code for
Flutter third-party plugins (i.e., plugins developed by Rody Davis).
Check the `packages` directory for all plugins.

Flutter plugins enable access to platform-specific APIs. For more information
about plugins, and how to use them, see
[https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## Issues

Please file any issues, bugs, or feature requests in the [
repo](https://github.com/AppleEducate/plugins/issues/new).

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute a new plugin to the Flutter ecosystem, please
see the documentation for [developing packages](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/) and
[platform channels](https://flutter.io/platform-channels/). You can store
your plugin source code in any GitHub repository. Once your plugin
is ready you can [publish](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/#publish)
to the [pub repository](https://pub.dartlang.org/).

If you wish to contribute a change to any of the existing plugins in this repo,
please review our [contribution guide](https://github.com/AppleEducate/plugins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
